# HyperIMU-ServerDll
server dll to receive packets from a android application, 'Hyper IMU'.
 If you want to test this program as a console application, set configuration type as Application by right click solution -> left click properties -> General -> configuration type -> select Application, then you'd be able to build and run the program. If you are done with testing and want to build the solution dll file, then reset the configuration type as dynamic library.
 this program is just barely working, so it would be appreciated if anyone improves on this project.
